    <h3> About us </h3>
    <p> Champeré found its humble beginnings in a small town in Imus with Susana Miranda spearheading the foundation in where Champeré now stands. 
    Susana, the founding mother of Champeré, traveled around the world with her much enthusiasm with wines that lead her to the city of Paris — 
    where she adopted the art of wine making and brought it back with her to her home country. </p>
